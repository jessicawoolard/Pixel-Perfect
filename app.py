    # 4. Loop over each row in the CSV. Each row is a blog post.

    # 5. Take post_html and replace {{title}} {{body}} {{author}} with the data in each blog post csv row

    # 6. Add the post_html to the new list you created above.

    # 7. Join all the items in your new list together into a single string. Name this string "blog_post_html".

    # 8. Open the index.html file and replace {{blog_posts}} with the blog post string you just created.
